# manjaro-branch-compare

Temporary replacement for Manjaro Branch Compare tool to show package's version in different branches. This tool replicates the `query` feature of the original tool to search directly for a package, example search for [firefox](https://ishaanbhimwal.github.io/manjaro-branch-compare/?query=firefox).

Also see [Manjaro Forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/congratulations-for-the-new-website/112215/28?u=ishaanbhimwal).
